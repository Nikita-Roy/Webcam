# Webcam

Hello connections, I have recently participated in an Event/Competition name 'Scale Up' conducted by Research and Development Cell, @CCA, where I have made an interesting project. So, I'm extremely excited to share my learning with all of you.

this project involves the usage of phone camera to work as scanners. In this project, we have connected the phone's camera with the laptop using IP Webcam and Python. After using some of the image processing techniques on the image the processed image has also been converted to pdf.

Made a pdf scanner using python and ip-webcam. The pdf scanner has the following features:
  1. converting an unreadable document into a readable one using adaptive thresholding
  2. converting an image into its black and white format
  3. removing noises using the property of gaussian blurring
  4. using canny edge detection to find the edges of a document
  5. cropping the document
  6. finding and drawing the contours of the given document
  7. resizing the given image
  8. adding a text to your document
  
  Technology used: Python, Image processing
  
  It was a great learning experience
  
  Thank you
